# Summary

Return Event IDs by default and selected Event content on request

## Scope

The Event result representation.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** return canonical Event IDs only unless the caller explicitly requests selected Event fields or complete Events.

## Details

Selected fields retain caller order and values; complete Events retain canonical Event bytes/structure. Missing selected fields are reported per Event and never silently synthesized.
