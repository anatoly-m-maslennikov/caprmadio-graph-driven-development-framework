# Require an object for a persistent effect owner

## Claim checked

one effect that owns identity, state, an invariant, a resource, a lifecycle, **or**
a replaceable adapter across calls is applied through a specifically named
object method.

## Test case

evaluate one standalone function that acquires a resource **and** retains its
lifecycle state for a later call.

## Acceptance criteria

pass **only** **when** the function is rejected **and** the persistent responsibility is
allocated **to** one object with explicit acquisition, use, **and** release boundaries.

## Failure disposition

reject the effect boundary **until** its persistent owner is explicit.
