# Summary

Deliver implementation prompt contract tests

## Scope

the future reviewed static and mock-E2E tests in the Implementation Workflow prompt package.

## Claim

the package **must** test source freshness, seven-Step coverage, exact Action/context/result labels, R/D-M-E packet separation, golden E2E preparation, handoff boundaries, and truthful retry/repair results.

## Details

These tests prove prompt-contract conformance only. They do not claim successful live LLM execution, implementation completion, Docker coverage, or MCP delivery.
