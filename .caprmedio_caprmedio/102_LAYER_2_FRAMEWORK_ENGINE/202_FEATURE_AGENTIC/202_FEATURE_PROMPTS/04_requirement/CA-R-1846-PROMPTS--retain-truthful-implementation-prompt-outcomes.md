# Summary

Retain truthful implementation prompt outcomes

## Scope

result and evidence returned by a current Implementation Workflow prompt.

## Claim

the Implementation **must** return only a result label admitted by its current Step plus actual outputs, input/source bindings, retained state, evidence references, and blockers; absent or unperformed checks never become a passing result.

## Details

An initial expected failing Evaluation consumes zero retries. Diagnosis, retry admission, repair, and renewed checking retain real state; a repair does not imply success. Method learning remains a separate CA-O-102 Workflow.
