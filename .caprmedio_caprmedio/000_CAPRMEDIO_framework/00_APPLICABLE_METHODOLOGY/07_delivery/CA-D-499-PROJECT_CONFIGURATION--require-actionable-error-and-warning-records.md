# Summary

Require actionable ERROR and WARNING records

## Scope

ERROR **and** WARNING production log records.

## Claim

an `ERROR` **or** `WARNING` record **must** be actionable: it identifies the failed **or** degraded condition, affected scope, expected operator **or** automated response, **and** whether retry is safe.

## Details

the required context makes the response **and** retry disposition explicit for the failed **or** degraded condition.
