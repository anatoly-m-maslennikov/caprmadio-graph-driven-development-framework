# Summary

Select reconciliation sources

## Operation

Select Reconciliation Sources **means** the reusable Action that resolves the complete source selection required by applicable governing authority **and** returns the exact selected source identities **and** Revisions as one source frontier. it **must** preserve source-selection constraints, include **every** eligible source, **and** retain unresolved selection ambiguity as a reported failure rather than silently choosing **or** discarding a source. selection does **not** change source authority **or** publish a Projection.
