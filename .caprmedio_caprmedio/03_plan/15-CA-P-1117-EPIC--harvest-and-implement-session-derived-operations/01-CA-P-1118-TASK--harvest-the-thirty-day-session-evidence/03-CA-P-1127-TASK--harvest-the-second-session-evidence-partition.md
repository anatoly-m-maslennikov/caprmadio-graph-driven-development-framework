# Summary

Harvest the second session evidence partition

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for harvest the second session evidence partition, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Use the frozen manifest for [September 12 05:54:15, September 20 05:54:15) +0400. Bind at most one session packet of at most 100 relevant human/assistant messages before execution. Distinguish proposed, explicitly accepted, superseded, and implemented statements.

### Required output

One bounded packet of traceable decision/candidate records plus an exact processed frontier; create additional <=15-minute subtasks for every remaining packet in the partition before the parent can finish.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

### Bound corpus source and next execution frontier

The completed metadata source is CA-A-905 at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-905-ANALYSIS_RPRT--inventory-the-session-evidence-corpus.md`, v1; supplemental rows are `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/manifest-CA-P-1176.json`. The snapshot contains 1659 retained files /1657 IDs, including all seven app-linked primary IDs and two continuation pairs. Read this durable source, not only the seven-session initial slice. The manifest distinguishes 17 primary files and1642 worker files; copied worker context does not establish a new Operator decision.

Bind the actual first <=100 relevant human/assistant-message packet to exact source paths, event timestamps and byte/line or app cursor boundaries for this Plan's date partition. Do not exclude older-created sessions by metadata date, mistake current app updated_at for event coverage, or drop native continuations without overlap evidence. Include corroborated worktree/repository and metadata-parent-chain sources when relevant. Carry every still-unprocessed source/event frontier into actual bounded harvest/remainder Plans; do not mark this partition Done from corpus discovery.

CA-C-294 binds candidate session `01a01cb6-4ee4-7553-b68d-0823dda35094`. Source-identity confirmation is its first bounded harvest check before adopting any content; record Project identity or a truthful unrelated/unavailable disposition and reuse that single result across partition Plans. Candidate uncertainty is not an authorization to consume unrelated Project content. No new generic metadata preflight is required: enumeration over both verified native roots is complete.

Preserve CA-P-1117's frozen window and explicit post-cutoff Operator corrections as separate amendments. Metadata gates are Done; downstream stage gates still require substantive harvest and its actual remainders.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
